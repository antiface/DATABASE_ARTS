# DATABASE_ARTS

__"DATABASE ARTS / TACTICAL MEDIA"__

__Project Overview:__

"DATABASE ARTS / TACTICAL MEDIA" is an interdisciplinary art-research project that explores the intersection of images, sound, and text within the context of the database genre. Drawing inspiration from Ervin Panofsky's concept of linear perspective as the symbolic form of the modern age, the project delves into how the world is increasingly perceived as an endless and unstructured collection of data, which is then modeled as a database.

__Project Components:__

- Images: The project incorporates a series of analog paintings and digital visual designs that reflect the database-like structure of contemporary existence. These images serve as visual representations of the data-driven nature of our reality, exploring themes of fragmentation, interconnectedness, and the fluidity of information.
- Sound: Traditional music and electronic music/computer-assisted sound design are utilized to enhance the immersive experience of the project. Soundscapes are created to evoke the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the digital landscape, with compositions reflecting the algorithmic logic that governs our interactions with data.
- Text: Poetry, novels, journals, and philosophical essays form an integral part of the project, offering textual reflections on the database genre and its implications for contemporary culture. These texts explore themes such as narrative fragmentation, the anti-narrative logic of the web, and the relationship between reality, media, and data.

__Key Concepts:__

- The Database Genre: The project explores the notion of the database genre, where new media objects appear as collections of items on which users can perform various operations such as viewing, navigating, and searching. Traditional genres, such as photo albums and bibliographies, are reinterpreted within this framework.
- Anti-Narrative Logic: The project challenges traditional narrative structures by highlighting the anti-narrative logic of the web, where new elements are continuously added over time, resulting in collections rather than cohesive stories. This approach disrupts conventional notions of linear storytelling and encourages a more open-ended exploration of data.
- Cultural Algorithm: The project investigates the cultural algorithm that shapes our understanding of reality, from media representations to data structures. By treating the world as a database, the project explores how our interactions with technology mediate our perception of reality and influence our cultural practices.

Post-Narrative/Post-Conversation: Through the creation of loosely connected and loosely coupled statements, the project transcends traditional modes of discourse, embracing a post-narrative and post-conversational approach. This allows for a more fluid and exploratory engagement with ideas and concepts, reflecting the non-linear nature of database aesthetics.

__Methodology:__

The project employs a serial method approach, utilizing time-series and lists of elements to create a database art experience. By embracing the arbitrary sequence of elements and rejecting linear narrative structures, the project encourages viewers to engage with the artwork on their own terms, navigating through the database of images, sounds, and texts in a non-linear fashion.

__Conclusion:__

"DATABASE ARTS / TACTICAL MEDIA" offers a multifaceted exploration of the database genre, incorporating images, sound, and text to create an immersive and thought-provoking experience. By interrogating the cultural implications of our increasingly data-driven world, the project seeks to challenge conventional modes of perception and spark new insights into the nature of contemporary existence.
